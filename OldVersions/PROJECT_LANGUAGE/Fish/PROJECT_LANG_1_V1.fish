# About:
# I decided to make Fish the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Fish) as Fish is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Fish programming language. It only makes sense to Fish the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
